Hi there

We note your hosting account is due to expire.

If you would like to renew your hosting, please ensure you renew before the expiry date. If your account is allowed to expire, your website files may be removed from our system.

If you require assistance with your renewal please do let us know.

============================================================================================

The transfer of the domain ************ to your Pixel Internet account has failed. This usually occurs because the domain has been locked by the previous registrar, or because the registrar or the listed administrative contact for the domain has failed to confirm the transfer.

Please check with your previous registrar that the domain is not locked and that they are willing to confirm the transfer, and make sure that email sent to the domain's administrative contact is read. Once complete, please contact us via this ticket so we may restart the transfer.

============================================================================================

Hi there

We are pleased to inform you that the domain name *************** has been successfully transferred into your account at Pixel Internet.


I'm sorry to hear you are having problems with your email, this is affecting lots of people, not just our customers, and the only people that can rectify the situation are BT/Yahoo.

Yahoo have extremely strict criteria for accepting email and often defer e-mail if they think that it might be spam or if they are busy - they call this 'de-prioritising email'. Unfortunately they have a very poor system that often defers perfectly acceptable email. Yahoo also run the e-mail system for BT so you may get the message sending to BT email addresses too.

It is widely known in the industry that Yahoo have this poor system and we always recommend that you do not use Yahoo for email purposes because of the amount of email that they block or defer.

Please note that there is nothing that we or any other web hosting company can do about this. Our mail servers will keep trying to deliver your message and Yahoo should eventually accept it.

============================================================================================


Your reseller plan has expired on the 1st May. Because the process was originally made via Google checkout, it will, unfortunately not automatically renew.

We have since changed our payment processing system to Sagepay, which will resolve this issue in the future.

Can I please ask you to login to your control panel and re-order your reseller plan for the domain crosswoodcomputers.co.uk and checkout as normal using your chosen credit/debit card.

This will then set up a reoccurring payment which will automatically renew your reseller plan for you each month.

If you could complete this at your earliest convenience it would be appreciated.

============================================================================================

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.Hi

In an on-going effort to improve our services, we have recently moved our payment processing to Sagepay. Because of this we need to ask you to re-order your reseller plan so that your re-occurring payment can be processed correctly.

<b>What we have done:</b>

We have cancelled your current Paypal subscription so you will no longer be billed.
We have unassigned your reseller domain ready for you to re-order.

<b>What we need you to do:</b>
Please login to your account at your earliest convenience, select 'order web hosting, select your main domain and add the reseller plan to your shopping cart. You may then process to the checkout and make your payment as normal.

<b>What we will do</b>
Once you have re-placed your order we will amend your renewal date so there are no days lost. We will also notify you once the process is complete.


============================================================================================


<b>Note</b>
If you have any problems or questions regarding this process please reply to this ticket and we will be happy to help. 

We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you in advance for your cooperation.Hi there

Due to lack of response from your side, I would need to go ahead and close this ticket. Should you need any further assistance please feel free to come back to this ticket. We value you as a Pixel Internet customer and we thank you for choosing Pixel Internet, have a nice day ahead.

============================================================================================

Hello ******

I am just looking into this for you now, your patience is greatly appreciated at this time. I will update you via this ticket once I have more information.

Hi *****

For security and in order to have SSH access to our servers please complete the attached SSH request form and return with the relevant paperwork.

You can either return via this ticket, or you can post it to:

Pixel Internet
PO BOX 4672
Worthing
West Sussex, BN11 9GF

Once complete we will be able to process the request for you.

============================================================================================
Hi there

It appears that Hotmail (and their related services, such as MSN and Windows Live!) are classing some email sent from this account as spam. Unfortunately their spam filtering policies are known only to them, and their bounce messages aren't very descriptive. Common causes include email matching spam-like characteristics, such as a high space-to-text ratio, malformed HTML body, IP address mismatches in the headers caused by relaying, or simply a missing subject line.

You may wish to submit your domain to the Microsoft Sender ID program:-

https://support.msn.com/default.aspx?page=global_propertynotsupported&productKey=senderid

Occasionally this is caused by a server block - we regularly check for these and request delisting immediately, although this can take Hotmail up to 48 hours to process. We take action against any users on our servers who are found to be spamming or causing our servers to be listed on blocklists.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

============================================================================================
Hi there

This is indicating that your IP is listed in the XBL - http://www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=**************** and the CBL

You should visit this page for a guide on how to get your IP unlisted:

http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=***************

Another fix is to completely unplug your router then turn it back on again after a few minutes. This should mean your ISP will assign you another IP (that is not listed in the XBL).

Once your IP is no longer listed, your emails we work again. (Your webmail should continue to work as normal in the meantime)

============================================================================================
In order for us to proceed with your domain transfer and process your order. Please login to your current host/registrar (Heart Internet) control panel, select 'manage domains', then after selecting your domain , select 'inter-transfer'.

You can view errors directly by using the View Remote Web Pages option in the Log File Download section of your Host Control Panel or by adding the following to your web.config file and then checking your access logs as the error will be output with a little more detail there:

&lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
&lt;system.webServer&gt;
&lt;httpErrors errorMode=&quot;Detailed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;

Please note the resolution with the web.config file will not output errors when using the temp URL.

============================================================================================

Normally backup feature can fail because there is a .htaccess file stopping it from running. Can you try renaming any htaccess file(s) and giving it another go?

============================================================================================
In order to send mail through our mail servers, your email client must be configured to use SMTP Authentication. Common email clients include a tickbox in the account configuration with the label "This server requires authentication". That box should be ticked, otherwise look for a setting on the outgoing server settings that refers to authentication and set it to use the same username and password for the incoming server. 

This issue can also occur with some ISPs which block port 25 for SMTP. Setting SMTP to port 587 should allow you to send email through us. 

If you continue to have problems, please supply the error codes or error messages they receive when trying to send email.

============================================================================================
Hello ******,

You can redirect the domain to www by placing the below code in the .htaccess file. Make sure that you replace the domain.co.uk with your actual domain name.

Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine on
rewritecond %{http_host} ^domain.co.uk [nc]
rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.co.uk/$1 [r=301,nc]


============================================================================================
We note your ticket login password no longer matches your main login password. For ease of use, would you like us to update this for you so they both match you main login details?

============================================================================================

Sorry about that, we had a issue with our ticket system, please ignore it.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Yes it is possible,in order to do this we would have to close the existing plan. It will mean deleteting all website and email content. So you will need to ensure you have backed up all data (site files, databases, email etc.) before we proceed (I'm afraid its not possible to migrate any existing data from Windows to Linux).

Hi ******

Please note that VPS and Dedicated servers are self managed, we are unable to offer technical support for these services. We do however offer free technical and network support should a hardware/network issue arise.

You need to ensure you have the ability/facility to support/manage these services yourself.

Hi *****

I will need to pass this to our billing team when they return ***********, they will then be able to deal with this for you then.

============================================================================================

When you place an order for a global domain transfer (.com etc.) an email is sent to the domains administrative contact (in this case is *********************).

The email prompts for you to confirm the transfer request and enter the domains Authorisation code (which you should have from your old host/registrar). 

If the email is not replied to, it waits for 7 days, then the transfer fails. 

Can you confirm you have access to the above email address and that you have received and confirmed the transfer request?

============================================================================================

Hi there

The transfer of the domain ****************** to your Pixel Internet account has failed. 

This is because the domain was registered less than 60 days ago and it is therefore not possible to transfer it.

In the meantime you can simply point the domain to our nameservers, then after 60days have passed please come back to this ticket and we will re-start the transfer process for you.

Our nameservers are:

ns1.pixelinternet.co.uk & ns2.pixelinternet.co.uk

Hello 

The process of changing the domain name assigned to your hosting account requires us to remove the old hosting account and reassign the hosting account with new domain name. During this process all emails/mailboxes that may have stored on the server will be removed. Hence we are requesting you to backup any emails stored on the server which you wish to retain. Once completed please update this ticket to confirm we can proceed with the domain change.

============================================================================================

Thank you for your recent VPS order - this is now being processed and should be active within 1 hour.

This email is legit and is simply a new verification email put in place by ICANN to show the ownership of the domain and to assure the email on the domain is legit for registration. You have nothing to worry about with this email and all you need to do is follow the instructions in the email to register this domain completely. 

If you have any further questions feel free to ask and I will be happy to help.

============================================================================================

All Pixel Internet infrastructure and shared web hosting servers (Starter, Home, Business & Pro) were patched as soon as the vulnerability was announced. We have also reissued our own SSL certificates to secure our customers' data.

We are currently setting up a bulk reissue process, once in place we will automatically reissue and install all shared web hosting certificates; shared hosting customers do not need to do anything.

============================================================================================

Hello *****,

Your current IP address is in Spain, however your account is registered to a UK address.

Due to the recent VAT laws that came into place in Jan 2015, its now required that your payment is made via the country you reside in.

Are you permanently based in Spain now? If you are - updating your records to your Spanish address will resolve the issue. If you are not then you will need to wait until you return to the UK in order to renew.

If you need any further assistance please do let me know.

============================================================================================


Hi there

Thank you for taking the time to read this ticket.

It has come to our attention that your hosting expired on the **/**/**** - whilst reminder emails are automatically sent out prior to expiry it seems the account is still overdue. 

As this has now come to the end of its grace period the service had been disabled. However should you wish to continue using the hosting space I have sent a payment request via email for your convenience.

Simply follow the 'view invoice' link in the email and run through the checkout - once payment is made the account can be re-enabled for you.

============================================================================================



Hello,

Unfortunately, we would be unable to provide further in-depth support for this hosting solution, as the server type that you have purchased from us was sold as unmanaged. This means that the server has been sold as a product separate from the additional service of technical support for software elements of the server. Hardware, of course, is something that we handle for you.

At this time we do not sell a managed version of this product. Most of our customers employ server management teams or individuals to maintain their sites and servers, or elect themselves as their own server managers based on their own technical background.

We can provide support for particular issues on a server, but we charge hourly for the use of our senior technical support team to identify the origin of your particular issue and seek a solution. If you would like to go down this route then I would be happy to procure a quote for you from their department. It should be noted, however, that we cannot guarantee a solution from their investigation due to the inherent complexities of internal server workings.

Obviously we appreciate that some matters regarding the server are out of your control, and we will always try to help as much as we can with a select category of server issues. However, I'm afraid that this particular issue does not fall within any of these categories. We are, of course, happy to point you in the right direction and will help you ascertain the root cause of your problem as best we can.

============================================================================================

Hello,

Regarding the domain ****** I'm afraid this has now gone into Redemption Period as it expired back in . The Redemption Period occurs 30 days after a domain has reached its expiration.
 
When a global domain they go into redemption period and there are two options made available by ICANN (who govern global domains):

a; you can pay a release fee to recover the domain which is £100 +vat which will then allow you to renew the domain

b; you can wait until the domain is released back onto the domain market and re-register (in which case we will refund your recent payment)

Option b can be risky as someone else could register the domain before you.

Please note that this is not something imposed by us, nor does the fee go to us.

============================================================================================
Hi there,
