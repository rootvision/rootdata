Note: Checking the git status again and again is good habit ( # git status) after every changes or work.

>> To tell Git who you are, run the following two commands
# git config --global user.name "King Kong"
# git config --global user.email "king-kong@gmail.com"

>> To turn on code highlighting, just run the following command
# git config --global color.ui true

>> The last basic configuration command will let you view your Git configurations. Running this command is the same as asking for a copy of your contract
# git config --list

>> To Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/new-folder/.git/
# git int

>> To know the git status
# git status

(Output)
$ git status
On branch master
Initial commit
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

>> To add all three files to the staging area. Instead of adding these files separately, we can add them all together.(file.ts,file.js,and file.rb)
# git add file.ts,file.js,and file.rb

>> To committing that you have added the three files
# git commit -m "Add three files"

(Output)
[master (root-commit) abfbdeb] Add three files
3 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
create mode 100644 file.js
create mode 100644 file.txt
create mode 100644 file.rb

>> There will be times when you'll regret committing to a repository. Let's say you've modified three files, but committed only two. How can you add that remaining file to the last commit? And how can you modify a file if you've already committed it? There are two ways out. First, you can undo the commit:

# git reset --soft HEAD^

As you may recall, the "reset" command is the opposite of the "add" command. This time, "reset" tells Git to undo the commit. What follows "reset" is the "--soft" option. The "--soft" option means that the commit is canceled and moved before HEAD. You can now add another file to the staging area and commit, or you can amend files and commit them.
					OR

>> Instead of resetting the HEAD and undoing the last commit, we can rectify a commit by using the "--amend" option when committing to a repository. Just add the remaining file to the staging area and then commit:
# git add file-i-forgot-to-add.html
# git commit --amend -m "Add the remaining file"

The "--amend" option lets you amend the last commit by adding a new file (or multiple files). Using the "--amend" option, you can also overwrite the message of your last commit.

>> First you need to bind this remote repository to your local repository
# git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/some-small-app.git

We tell Git to "add" a repository. The "origin" option is the default name for the server on which your remote repository is located. Lastly, there's a link to your project on GitHub.

Once you run the command above, Git will connect your local and remote repositories. But what does this liaison actually mean? Can you already access your code online? Unfortunately, not yet.

>> All you did for now is signed papers so that the remote lock box (GitHub) can accept various items (your code) from your home drawer (local repository). To actually copy your things to a remote lock box, you need to personally carry them to it. With Git, copying your code to a remote repository looks like this
# git push -u origin master

It's obvious that the command "push" tells Git to push your files to a remote repository. What we also specified is the server our local repo is connected to (origin) and the branch we're pushing, which is master. There's also that strange "-u" option. What it means is that we're lazy enough not to run a long "git push -u origin master" command each time we push code to the cloud. Thanks to "-u", we can run only "git push" next time!"

>> As we can see, there's an SSH option that we can use instead of HTTPS. If you set up Git on your computer to work with SSH, then you won't have to enter GitHub credentials every time you push code to GitHub. You'll only need to add a remote origin with this SSH link, like this for command line
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/your-app.git

>> You can view the list of repositories by running the following command
# git remote -v

The "-v" option will list all remote repositories you've connected to. This is what we've got
origin	https://github.com/YourName/some-app.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/YourName/some-app.git (push)

>>  Git can clone an entire project from a remote repository. That's what the "clone" command does.
# git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/your-app.git

>> Running "git pull" is enough to update your local repository.
# git pull

When you run the "pull" command, Git will:

Pull changes in the current branch made by other developers; and
Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository.

The "pull" command doesn't create a new directory with the project name. Git will only pull updates to make sure that your the local repository is up to date.

>> To see our current branches.
# git branch

>> To create a new branch.
# git branch user-profile

Let's run the "git branch" command once more
$ git branch
*master
user-profile

>> Switching branches in Git, you won't use a "switch" command, as you might think. Instead, you'll need to use "checkout"
# git checkout user-profile
Switched to branch 'user-profile'

Git also notifies you that you've switched to a different branch: "Switched to branch 'user-profile'". Let's run "git branch" once more to prove that
$ git branch
master
*user-profile

>> To merge a secondary branch into the main branch (which can be a master, development, or feature branch), first switch back to the main branch. In our case, we should checkout the master branch
# git checkout master
*master
user-profile

>> The current branch is now changed to master, and we can merge the user-profile branch using the command "merge"
# git merge user-profile

** Set-up remote git repository on a standard server
====================================================

* The first thing to do is to install Git on the remote server.

* Once you do that the rest of the process is split into three sections:

Server set-up
Local set-up (push commits)
Server (pull commits)

** Server set-up
=================
ssh -pxxxx username@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (this is you connecting to your remote server)
cd ../ (this gets you to the 'absolute root' of the server)
cd www/..../ (navigate to the directory one level above your website directory - e.g. your website directory being where you would upload your HTML files etc)

** Note: if (for example) your web directory is httpdocs then move up one level from there.

** The following example assumes httpdocs is your web directory...
==================================================================
rm -rf httpdocs (remove the web directory - you'll recreate it again in a minute)
mkdir httpdocs && cd httpdocs (create new web directory folder and move inside it)
git init (initiate new git repo)
cd ../ (jump back up a directory level)

** The following three commands are the black magic for getting a remote git repo setup:
========================================================================================
git clone --bare httpdocs httpdocs.git
mv httpdocs httpdocs.backup
git clone httpdocs.git

** Local set-up (push commits) >> You can Ignore this If git is configured locally
===================================================================================
cd ~/Desktop/Sites/myWebsite
git init
git add *
git commit -m 'Start of new project'
git remote add origin ssh://username@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx/www/.../httpdocs.git
git push origin master

*** Server (pull commits)
=========================
cd ../
cd www/..../httpdocs/
git status
git fetch
git pull origin master


**  On Remote server
====================

mkdir project
git init
git clone --bare project project.git
mv project project.backup
git clone project.git


** On Local system
===================
git remote add deploy ssh://root@192.168.1.192/var/www/html/server-testing/demo-testing.git
git push deploy master

** On Remote server
===================
git status
git fetch
git pull origin master

== >> Steps to renaming local and remote branches
* Renaming local branch to the new name
- To rename the local branch to the new name, use the git branch command followed by the -m option:
$ git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>

- To delete the old branch on remote (suppose, the name of remote is origin, which is by default), use the following command:
$ git push origin --delete <old-name>

- Pushing the new branch to remote
$ git push origin <new-name>
