Python pty module:
One of my go-to commands for a long time after catching a dumb shell was to use Python to spawn a pty. The pty module letâ€™s you spawn a psuedo-terminal that can fool commands like su into thinking they are being executed in a proper terminal. To upgrade a dumb shell, simply run the following command:

:python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
:python -c import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
