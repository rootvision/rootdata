Spam tracking in EximÂ¶

1) Find the mailqueue count

#exim -bpc
#exim -bpc

2) The following script will give the summary of mails in the mail queue.

#exim -bpr | exiqsumm -c | head

#exiqgrep -i -f user@domain.com > gives the mailID of mails send from user@domain.com

#exiqgrep -i -r user@domain.com > gives the mailID of mails send to user@domain.com

3) See the headers of the mail to see whether it is spam or not.

#exim -Mvh mail-id

And to see the message body

#exim -Mvb mail-id

4) Run the following command to pull the most used mailing script's location from the Exim mail log:

#grep cwd /var/log/exim_mainlog | grep -v /var/spool | awk -F"cwd=" '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

5) Now go through the scripts in that directory and find the script from mails are generating.

We can see what IP addresses are accessing this script using the following command:

#grep "script.php" /home/user/access-logs/example.com | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -n

6)You can use the following command to get the dovecot logins to the email accounts in the server(attempts via email client)

#egrep -o 'dovecot_login[^ ]+' /var/log/exim_mainlog | sort|uniq -c|sort -nk 1

If the count is high, the account may be compromised.

7) To get a sorted list of email sender in exim mail queue. It will show the number of mails send by each one.

exim -bpr | grep "<" | awk {'print $4'} | cut -d "<" -f 2 | cut -d ">" -f 1 | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -n
8) To remove all mails in queue from a specific sender.

exiqgrep -i -f user@domain.com | xargs exim -Mrm

exigrep @ /var/log/exim_mainlog | grep _login | sed -n 's/.*_login:\(.*\)S=.*/\1/p' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr -k1 		-->> to list the specific spammer email address

exigrep @ /var/log/exim_mainlog | grep U= | sed -n 's/.*U=\(.*\)S=.*/\1/p' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr -k1			-->>  to list the specific spammer user
